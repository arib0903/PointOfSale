# Point of Sale

# Functionality:
- A Desktop Application programmed in Scala which mimicked the functionality of grocery checkout machines commonly seen in stores. The application was developed using object-oriented code and displays results using a pre-programmed GUI. 
- The application also was programmed to contain a sale option, and when initiated on the GUI, the prices for select items would be reduced.
- A distinct number would be pressed on a GUI to scan a specific item; Where the GUI represented the screen on a modern checkout machine.


# NOTE:
- This was a University project where we were responsible for programming the main functionality of the application. And the GUI was given to us pre-programmed by our professor.
