# Point of Sale

# Functionality:
A Desktop Application programmed in Scala which mimicked the functionality of grocery checkout machines commonly seen in stores. The application was developed using object-oriented code and displays results using a pre-programmed GUI. 

# NOTE:
This was a University project where we were responsible for programming the main functionality of the application. And the GUI was given to us pre-programmed by our professor.
